            Hi, I'm Kelly, the developer behind Red Flannel. I specialize in web application development, but I am a versatile software engineer. With over a decade of  practical work experience, I focus on building high-quality solutions with an appreciation for detail and craftsmanship often missing in the freelance industry.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>I particularly enjoy building in C#, React, and Python for projects, organizations, or individuals that are focused on doing social good or deemphasize profit as their singular goal. I am committed to good communication, honesty, and successful project completion. I use <Link href="https://deconforming.com/they-them-pronouns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they/them/their pronouns</Link>.</Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>Red Flannel is an LGBTQ-owned business located in Seattle, Washington, but I have many years of experience working remotely for clients all over the world. I have produced work for a variety of industries, including retail/eCommerce, finance, education, non-profits, and more. I've worked with marketing managers, researchers, graphic designers, consulting agencies, therapists, small businesses, website designers, artists, and so many more.</Typography>
