          <Typography paragraph>Hi, I'm Kelly, and I am the developer behind Red Flannel. I specialize in web application development and build high-quality solutions with an appreciation for detail and craftsmanship often missing in the freelance industry. I use <Link href="https://deconforming.com/they-them-pronouns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they/them pronouns</Link>.</Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>I'm a versatile software engineer and web developer with over a decade of practical work experience (you can find my full CV on <Link href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellycarterit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</Link>). I particularly enjoy building in C#, React, and Python. I am committed to good communication, honesty, and successful project completion.</Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>Red Flannel is located in Seattle, Washington, but I have many years of experience working remotely for clients all over the world. I am particularly interested in contributing to organizations or projects that focus on doing social good or deemphasize profit as a singular motivator, but I have experience in a variety of industries, from solar energy to financial education, non-profits to retail.</Typography>
